# Train-Scheduler

Train Scheduler is an application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. It retrieves and manipulates information with Moment.js. It provides up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

Administrators can submit the following:
* Train Name
* Destination
* First Train Time -- in military time
* Frequency -- in minutes
* Calculate when the next train will arrive; this is relative to the current time (central time)
* Users from many different machines can view same train times
